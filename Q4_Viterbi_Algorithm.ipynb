    "## IMPORTANT\n",
    "\n",
    "I have implemented two versions of the Viterbi algorithm due to confusion regarding the correct handling of the transition to the `END` state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First Implementation**:\n",
    "  - This version **handles the transition to `END` only if the last state is `I`**.\n",
    "  - Consequently, paths ending in states other than `I` (e.g., all `'E'`s) are **not penalized** and can yield a valid probability.\n",
    "  - This results in the best path being **all `'E'`s**, and the log probability is finite.\n",
    "  - This version matches the solution found on GitHub and treats the `END` state transition as optional or dependent only on ending in `I`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Second Implementation**:\n",
    "  - Here, **the transition to the `END` state is applied regardless of the final state**.\n",
    "  - Since the only non-zero probability of transitioning to `END` is from `I`, paths that **do not end in `I`** will have a **log probability of `-inf`**.\n",
    "  - As a result, paths like all `'E'`s are **not valid** final paths.\n",
    "  - This forces the algorithm to choose a path that ends in `I`, resulting in a best path of `'EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE5IIIIIII'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** This difference does **not fundamentally alter the core implementation or logic** of the Viterbi algorithm. It only changes how the final transition is treated, which affects the resulting path under certain HMM configurations."
